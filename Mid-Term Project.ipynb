Even now, as he has played the same number of games as Michael Jordan, I believe he is the greatest of all time. That being said, I understand that there is bias in my argument. I grew up as a kid watching LeBron James, not Michael Jordan. Half of my family lived/lives in Cleveland, just outside of his hometown of Akron, Ohio, and in the heart of the city whos team he plays for. With side notes aside, let's take a look at the data and determine who Python thinks is the best of the two."

From notepad, I exported/saved the file as a CSV file onto my desktop. After this step, I started to clean my document. It did not have any issues with things that were hard to sort, because this wasn't exactly a \"big data\" file. Instead, the cleaning took barely any time at all, and in the end I saved the new, cleaned document as a new CSV file into my Big Data folder, which I then imported into the lab.\n",

If we wanted to know which header was what number, then code would need to be run to state what header number is what column. It isn't really necessary, because the point of the graph is to show the general trend of correlations relative to points, with data from earlier stating what that header is called."

    "## Data Analysis and Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- After analyzing the data, it can be determined that Michael Jordan was a much better scorer than LeBron James. What is interesting is just how high the correlation factor between field goals and points is from Michael Jordan's data, coming in at a .97 r value. LeBron's highest r value is also field goals, his being only .9 though.\n",
    "- Michael Jordan's highest correlations are much higher than LeBron's as well. MJ has the \"2 pointers\" column at a much higher correlation coefficient than LeBron's, another interesting thing to note.\n",
    "- What is also interesting is that Michael Jordan's steals also had a super high correlation to points scored. This is interesting to note, because one conclusion from that information would be that the better defense you play, the more effective you are on offense.\n",
    "- A couple things to note are that these are only correlations between points and other categories. Random anomalies stick out like Offensive Rebounds in LeBron's data, which has an r value of 0.06. It would generally make sense that the more offensive rebounds you rack up, the more points you would score because you can just shoot the ball right after you grab the rebound. Especially because LeBron James is such a good finisher at the rim, it makes no sense why Offensive Rebounds would have nothing to do with the number of points you score on a game-to-game basis.\n",
    "- In the end, Michael Jordan is the better scorer than LeBron James. However, I don't think that this gives quite enough credit to LeBron for being an all-around basketball player, not just a scorer. To determine who the better overall basketball player is, I think more information would be necessary in order to draw that conclusion.\n",
    "- In the future, I would hope to do more with code if I knew how to do it, or if I spent my entire weekend trying to figure out how best to portray my data. Lots of segments of code are left with errors, and that's fine with me because at least I tried to make it work in the first place."
